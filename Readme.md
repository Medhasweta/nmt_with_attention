# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to implement a neural machine translation (NMT) model using a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture with Bahdanau's Attention mechanism. NMT is a state-of-the-art approach to machine translation that has achieved impressive results on a variety of language pairs.

# Project Purpose

This project has the potential to be used for a variety of purposes, including:

Translating documents from one language to another
Providing real-time translation for speech and text
Developing machine translation tools for low-resource languages

# Key Concepts

# Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture: 
A seq2seq model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder reads an input sequence and produces a hidden state that represents the input sequence. The decoder then reads the hidden state and generates an output sequence.

# Attention mechanism: 
The attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating the output sequence. This is important for machine translation because it allows the decoder to translate words in the context of the entire input sentence.

# Bahdanau's Attention: 
Bahdanau's Attention is a popular attention mechanism that is used in many NMT models. It is a relatively simple attention mechanism to implement, and it has been shown to be effective for a variety of language pairs.

# Conclusion

This project provides a starting point for implementing an NMT model using a seq2seq architecture with Bahdanau's Attention mechanism. The project can be used for a variety of purposes, and it can be extended to support other NLP tasks.
